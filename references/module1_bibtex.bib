abstract = {This paper presents possibilities of an error reduction of the phase estimation with an interpolated discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The properties of interpolations are studied for the rectangular and Hanning windows with respect to their ability for correction systematic effects. The correction is improved by considering the leakage effect of the component spectrum. Uncertainties of the phase estimations have been studied. The simulation and experimental results are presented, showing the effectiveness in estimating the phase of the signal component.},

abstract = {An analysis is made to study the influence of time-domain noise on the results of a discrete Fourier transform (DFT). It is proven that the resulting frequency-domain noise can be modeled using a Gaussian distribution with a covariance matrix which is nearly diagonal, imposing very weak assumptions on the noise in the time domain.},

abstract = {This research monograph on circular data analysis covers some recent advances in the field, besides providing a brief introduction to, and a review of, existing methods and models. The primary focus is on recent research into topics such as change-point problems, predictive distributions, circular correlation and regression, etc. An important feature of this work is the S-plus subroutines provided for analyzing actual data sets. Coupled with the discussion of new theoretical research, the book should benefit both the researcher and the practitioner. <br><i>Contents:</i><ul><li>Circular Probab},

abstract = {Approaches such as the Transfer Function and the Fourier and the Laplace transforms are important tools for bioengineers that often considered borrowed from electrical engineering. This text allows bioengineering students and bioengineers the ability to foster a sense of ownership of these tools by providing them with a solid foundation in the concepts of linear systems analysis. Circuits, Signals and Systems for Bioengineers guides readers through the basic engineering concepts that underlie biological systems, medical devices, biocontrol, and biosignal analysis. Material important to their study and traditionally taught in an electrical engineering service course can now be embraced by bioengineers. Instructive illustrations and MATLAB routines and examples are provided throughout the book. * Translates important electrical engineering tools such as Fourier Transform, Laplace Transform, analog modeling, systems modeling, and other linear systems analysis techniques for bioengineering students. * Includes MATLAB examples and problems.},
